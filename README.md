# Secure Programming Revision Notes

I'm trying to make some revision notes for the VU Secure Programming course for 2018. If you want to be added as a collaborator, [send me an email](mailto:github-contact@jacobsburley.com). This document is written in LaTeX, and is automatically compiled and deployed to [releases](https://github.com/jc0b/SecureProgrammingSummary/releases) by [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org).

# Known issues
I'm going to try and keep track of the issues that arise with this guide (especially ones that I have with using Travis CI) in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jc0b/SecureProgramming/issues). So, if you want to work on this document as well, keep an eye on the issue tracker for any LaTeX commands that might cause build failures at the moment.
Thanks!
